## Dynamic websites are dead

### Once upon a time

Once upon a time, in order to catch new customers, we said them:

* "We make it dynamic so you can update it as you want"
* "We make it dynamic so you can insert the news every day"

The results:

* Horrible pages formatted with bold text, capital letters and no newlines.
* Lot of sites with two years old news
* Lot of sites with the only news "Welcome to our brand new site!"
* Lot of email in your inbox, tagged as "unpaid-work": 
  "Here's a word doc with the update of the story of the company, could you publish it?
  I've lost my password, and it's a job of few minutes for you"

### Today

* Sites with news was a failure: companies write in their social profiles
* Texts have to be SEO friendly, so the client does not have to write them.

### Now

* Do we really need a dynamic website?
