#### Fundraising Platform

For the foundraising platform they used **Jekyll** to generate html staic pages.

*By using Jekyll we managed to **avoid the complexity** that comes with most CMS (databases, server configuration)*

*and instead **focus** on things like optimizing the UI and providing a better user experience.*

*To work in this environment the most a frontend engineer had to learn was the Liquid template language that Jekyll uses and boy is that **simple**.*

*We **didn't have to work with Devops to deploy** because all we had to do was overwrite files on S3 and invalidate a URL on our CDN.*

*There is a lot to be said about **simplicity**.*
